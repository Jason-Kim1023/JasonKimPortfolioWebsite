# Jason Kim's Portfolio website utilizing React.js and CSS
This website was created to showcase some of my projects and give recruiters a little more information about who I am and what I am interested in.  It also gave me a chance to learn more about front-end development and tools like React, which are used regularly in the tech industry.
